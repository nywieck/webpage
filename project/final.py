# Tic-tac-toe game, player vs computer. Player can choose easy, hard, or impossible play modes.
# Keeps track of wins, losses, and games played, and asks if user wants to continue playing or quit after each game.

# Basic overall program design and implementation concepts were very important prior to starting to code, and still changed over time.
#   Important conepts included:
#       1) Tracking board state with a dictionary with keys as board squares and values as -1 (player), 0 (open), and 1 (computer).
#       2) How to design overall game loops in the playGame function. Eventually became obvious board state would have to be passed
#               through entire game and all other functions as input parameter and output return for game to function as we designed it.
#       3) How to track effectively track play mode, player turn throughout entire program and game state.
#               Carefully defining, updating, and passing nextTurn value is important. This was a challenging problem to solve because
#               so many different functions are called that require different parameters be passed to behave as desired.
#               For example the endGame function requires 3 parameters are passed so will behave correctly.
#       4) Computer decision making process (required most strategic problem solving, and is majority of game code).
#               There is probably a more effective way to implement the computer decision making process by identifying underlying patterns,
#               but it works, and we evaluated all the potential outcomes and strategies on our own without looking up any strategies
#               and/or code online.

# The two most important variables in the program are probably "nextTurn" and "board". They are passed through many functions.
#   "nextTurn" variable is an integer value (-2 is player wins, -1 is computer wins, 0 is draw, 1 is computers turn, 2 is players turn).
#   "board" variable is a dictionary: keys 1-9 represent board squares, and corresponding value -1 for player owns square,
#   0 for square available, and 1 for computer owns square.

# Sample of overall function call flow is:
#   main()
#       -> playGame()
#           -> coinToss()
#               -> drawBoard(board)
#                   -> compTurn(board, keepPlaying)
#                       -> decisionHard(board, mode)
#                           -> drawBoard(board)
#                               -> endGame(board, player, mode)

# keepPlaying loop primarily keeps track of game mode (easy, hard, impossible, quit), game running totals, and contains nextTurn loop.
# nextTurn loop keeps track of game to determine if win, loss, draw or continue, tracks and controls turns by calling playerTurn or compTurn.
